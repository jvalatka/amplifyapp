      <p>
        Joseph "Jay" Valatka is a PC technician and web developer who continues to work with many individuals and

        Jay refers to himself as a "tenacious problem solver." For every problem carefully defined after initial 
        visits with a client, he seeks and selects the proper tools and knowledge that will provide the best all-around 
        solution. The solution could be a small network, new PC hardware, or software applications. Jay also has 
        decades of experience helping others become more knowledgeable about their PCs and how to more effectively use 
        them.

        Jay has grown up with Microsoft-based systems, starting with those heady days of MS-DOS and continuing onward 
        with the latest Windows operating system. However, he also uses open-source solutions frequently, with most of 
        his work done on Ubuntu Linux.

        for a local film production.
